These are release builds of games I developed back in 2014

What is the value of the release of these game builds?
This was among the 1st times I was a Lead software developer and saw a game into to full release these projects were done with my team members at the time and we had a successful release this also shows that I have released a game before regardless of level or time period it was in.
